# **Project Title: Email Spam Detection using Machine Learning**

### **Project Description:**

#### This project implements an email spam detection system using machine learning algorithms, specifically Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Logistic Regression. It leverages the TF-IDF technique for feature extraction and explores hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

#### SVM achieved higher accuracy compared to Logistic Regression.
#### TF-IDF proved to be effective in capturing relevant features.
#### Hyperparameter tuning further improved SVM's performance.
#### The project offers a practical approach to email spam detection using machine learning.
